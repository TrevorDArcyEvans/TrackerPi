# Reinventing the wheel but with a Raspberry Pi
Why buy a perfectly round wheel when you can build make a clunky one?

# Background
For new car drivers, many insurance companies require installing a smart phone
app which records speed and position.  This is so the insurer can monitor how
safely the new driver is performing (or not).  There are also various apps
which do similar things.  Some of the apps also connect to the car's
OBD (On Board Diagnostics) via a bluetooth adaptor to also record various 
vehicle parameters eg road speed, engine speed, selected gear, etc
